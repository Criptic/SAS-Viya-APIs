# SAS-Viya-APIs
This repository walks you through examples and use cases around the SAS Viya APIs. For its general structure we are going to be following the categories that are being used by the official SAS Developers Documentation page: https://developer.sas.com/rest-apis. Categories will be in their own folders and then within the folders you will find content to make use of these APIs.

Each folder will also contain a README file to help provide a quick overview of what is available there. For the examples there will usually also be a video companion piece and all of them are collected in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLncvHGGelzhV1adu602TnJ-vgim4XEmE_.

## [Visualization and Reports](https://github.com/Criptic/SAS-Viya-APIs/blob/main/Visualizations-and-Reports)
