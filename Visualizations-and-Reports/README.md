# Visualization and Reports

Collects APIs around SAS Visual Analytics and the reports created within it. Here you can find examples on how to programmatically created/update/copy/delete reports or create exports of the reports.

## Visual Analytics API

The Visual Analytics API enables us to perform basic operations for reports from creation, to changing a report, to exporting it and to finally deleting the report. Find the full documentation [here](https://developer.sas.com/rest-apis/visualAnalytics).

The example provided here is a SAS Notebook which you have to open making use of VS Code with the SAS Language Extension for VS Code installed - [SAS-Visual-Analytics-API.sasnb](./SAS-Visual-Analytics-API.sasnb). Find it demonstrated in this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/b3mAOTfeTe4).
